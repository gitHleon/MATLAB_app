Errors to debug in the near future:
1- Dispenser communication fail-rate about 5-8% (Improve wiring; Add a retry instruccion in method "DISPENSER.SetUltimus(cmd)")

Error to be debugged in the future:
1- function WaitForMotion --> A timeout error have no real effect. An error appear in the Command Window and program execution continues
2- function WaitForMotion --> It doesn't separate correctly axis. WaitForMotion(oneAxis) will wait until ALL the axis movements finishes.
3- STAGES and OWIS_STAGES classes --> Different uses of internal variables may cause confusion during debugging.


Camera crashes when fast movements
Sometimes crashes while focusing with autofocus. Must fix it.
Focus doesn't work with calibration board when background is not white

Img = rot90(Img,rotation);

info = rendererinfo(gca)
opengl info
opengl ( 'hardware' )

Img = imrotate(imagen1,alfa);

DispCam should not fit to windows and keep proportions
camCalibration should be loaded at the begging of loading class¿¿??
